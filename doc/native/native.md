# AdaOS Native

__AdaOS Native__ is an implementation of [AdaOS](../adaos/adaos.md) which runs on top of the
'bare metal', meaning that there is no software (operating system, platform, monitor, etc.)
upon which AdaOS Native is based. It is totally self-contained and has everything needed to run
application programs on a computer. The computer only has to provide a processor, memory, and
peripheral circuitry (plus, typically, a means to start the bootstrapping of the computer).
