# Domain Identifier Allocation

Every object domain is globally, permanently, and forever identified by a _domain identifier_. 

A domain identifier is an opaque token, but it is not of a fixed size. Instead, it is a bit array ......



Domains are grouped, with a fixed _prefix_ value identifying each group. The overall value of a
domain identifier is its prefix followed by a _remainder_. The remainder must be a value that
uniquely identifies the domain with its group. 

How a remainder is allocated within a group will be defined by the group.

Every group has a _domain group owner_, which is a legal entity within a specific legal
jurisdiction. 




| Length | Prefix       | Owner                 | Description                       |
| ------ | ------------ | --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1      | `01`         | AdaOS Project, The    | Domains 

The length is in bytes. The prefix is expressed in hexadecimal.

## Domain Identifier Prefix Allocation

Prefixes are, for the time being, allocated manually by The AdaOS Project. 

Please contact us to discuss having prefixes allocated to you. 

We do not currently charge any money for allocating prefixes. 


### Making a Request

When making a request, you must specify: 

 * The number of prefixes you require, and a short piece of text describing the purpose of each
   one. Usually, only one prefix will be needed, in which case the text can be something like
   "General". 

 * The jurisdiction (country or equivalent) of the legal entity that is to be the owner of the
   new prefix or prefixes. 

 * The legal entity which is to be the owner of the new prefix or prefixes. A legal entity is
   either a person or a company (or similar organisation) within the specified jurisdiction. We
   will always check this. 

 * The contact details (typically, name, address, telephone number, permanent email address) of
   yourself or someone who can be contact should any questions arise as to the allocation of
   the prefix or prefixes. 


### Refusal

We cannot make any promises as to the length of the prefix we allocate to you, nor to its
specific value, but we do make a commitment not to refuse to allocate prefixes for any
illegitimate reason. 

We reserve the following as legitimate reasons to refuse: 

 * The request is not genuine. For example, if the requestor cannot convince us the request is
   not a joke. 

 * The request is not on behalf of a genuine legal entity. The owner of a prefix must be a
   legal entity within a specified jurisdiction. The jurisdiction must be specified, along with
   the (full and proper name of the) legal entity. We will check always this. 

 * The requestor cannot convince us they are an authorised representative of the legal entity
   on behalf of which they are making the request. 

 * The request seems excessive. This will only apply if a large number of prefixes are being
   requested (at once or over a period of time) for a particular legal entity. 

 * We do not recognise the jurisdiction. For example, we may refuse to recognise a jurisdiction
   that is not recognised by a large number of other sovereign states. 

 * We have cause to believe that the prefix or prefixes will be used for illegal or immoral
   purposes. 

The owner of a prefix must be a legal entity within a specified jurisdiction. Most
jurisdictions have a concept of a 'dead' (person) or 'dissolved' (company) that continues to be
a legal entity in some sense. We will not allocate prefixes to a dead or dissolved legal
entity, but we will continue to recognise allocations to entities that have afterwards become
dead or dissolved. The executor (or whoever is authorised to act on behalf of the entity) is
permitted to voluntarily relinquish or transfer a prefix, but is not obliged to.
