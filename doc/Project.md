# __The AdaOS Project__

The __AdaOS Project__ is a group of volunteers collaborating to create and maintain a complete 
general-purpose operating system written principally in the standard Ada programming 
language.

ECLAT is the first step towards making AdaOS a reality. 

ECLAT (Experimental Compiler Library and Tools) will compile source text into libraries, build 
pseudo-code modules from libraries, and realise into directly executable machine code. It will 
support multiple programming languages.

## Licence

All software published as part of the AdaOS Project will be published under the [GNU General 
Public License version 3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/). 

This licence requires that all software published under its terms must either be published in 
the form of source text, or the relevant source must be made available to anyone to whom it is 
published.

Thus, the AdaOS Project will be an [open source](https://opensource.org/) project.

## Who Are You?

I am Nick Roberts, crusty veteran of the computer world, and still dreaming.

Email: [nick.roberts@acm.org](mailto:nick.roberts@acm.org)

I am seeking contributors and supporters for this project.

By the way, I am from the UK, so please forgive me if my spelling sometimes seems strange. I intend the identifiers in all the project's source text to have North American spelling.
