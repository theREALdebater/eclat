# Biographies

The AdaOS project members introduce themselves here.

## Nick Roberts

I am a crusty veteran of the computer programming industry, having done nothing else my whole 
adult life. 

I am a mad dreamer. I fell in love with Ada---the programming language---at soon as I became 
aware of it, in 1983, and have remained in love ever since. 

My dream is to start the creation of a new Ada compiler (ECLAT) and to use it to create a new 
standalone execution platform (operating system) named [AdaOS](AdaOS.md). 


### World Community Grid

I am a contributor to the [World Community Grid][1], which uses volunteers' spare computing 
power to help with scientific research. 

World Community Grid enables anyone with a computer, smartphone or tablet to donate their 
unused computing power to advance cutting-edge scientific research on topics related to health, 
poverty and sustainability. Through the contributions of over 650,000 individuals and 460 
organizations, World Community Grid has supported 31 research projects to date, including 
searches for more effective treatments for cancer, HIV/AIDS and neglected tropical diseases. 
Other projects are looking for low-cost water filtration systems and new materials for 
capturing solar energy efficiently. 

Support the research into COVID-19. Scientists at Scripps Research are using World Community 
Grid to help search for potential treatments for COVID-19, and to build open-source tools to 
help address future pandemics quickly and early. 

I am a member of the volunteer team named "Time for a world space program". Please join us!
