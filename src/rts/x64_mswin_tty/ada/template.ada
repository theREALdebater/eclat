-- The AdaOS Project

-- The AdaOS Project aims to create a fundamentally new operating system,
-- which combines the features of reliability and good software engineering
-- with those of easy installation, configuration, maintenance, and use not
-- typically found in current offerings. Concomitant with these objectives,
-- we intend to write most of AdaOS in the Ada 95 programming language.

-- We hope that AdaOS will eventually become a fully-fledged general-
-- purpose operating system, providing a highly secure distributed
-- transaction-based promiscuous application execution environment.
